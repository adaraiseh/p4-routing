This repository is used by me to share research experiments based on P4. 

The current demos you can find here:

1. ** Install P4utils on a clean Ubuntu 22.03 ** - this process will take a long time

wget -O install-p4-dev.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adaraiseh/p4-routing/refs/heads/master/install-p4-dev.sh

bash install-p4-dev.sh

2. **IP routing Pro** - This demo shows how to implement a basic IP routers with static routing entries using P4, BMv2 and Mininet.
